  </FAQ>
  <FAQ Question="How do I add or remove a skill?"
         Answer="DXC should not want to receive another party’s confidential information because DXC will 
                 then have the burden to maintain that information as confidential, and DXC’s freedom of 
                 invention and action may be compromised because of knowing such confidential information. 
                 However, in situations where it is necessary for DXC to receive such sensitive information
                 from another party, a proper Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) should be executed 
                 before receiving such information. Please refer to the “Receiving Sensitive Information” 
                 section in the &lt;a href=&quot; http://standards.int.hpe.com/policy/docs/hpe010-04.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DXC Confidential Information Policy&lt;/a&gt;.">

  <FAQ Question="How do I view my skills?"
       Answer="In general, these are just different titles for the same type of document intended to protect
               the disclosure of sensitive information. At DXC, we refer to this document as a Confidential 
               Disclosure Agreement (CDA). Please note that a CDA or NDA is different than the document 
               called the Non-Confidential Disclosure Agreement (“NCDA”), which is intended to establish 
               that neither party is sharing anything of confidential nature.">
